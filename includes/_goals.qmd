2.  To develop the framework as installable software so that it can be
    used across health research organizations, small-to-medium sized
    companies, or research groups or teams to better connect data
    collectors, researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders to
    created data.

3.  To improve and strengthen software and data engineering capacity
    within health research by developing educational and training
    material, as well as running workshops.
