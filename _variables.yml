design:
  data-resource: |
    This is the "instance" created by Seedcase that
    manages and stores data from a research study or data source. For
    example, our external partner DD2 (listed below in the Stakeholder
    section) collects a wide variety of data on a set of participants.
    The data generated from these participants enrolled with DD2 would
    form a single "Data Resource".
  whitebox: |
    A description of the internal functioning and behaviour of a system.
    For example, how the internals of Seedcase like the web frontend part,
    the programmatic API part, and the data backend environment part interact
    with each other. "White" implying seen or visible (e.g. daylight).
  blackbox: |
    A description of the external functioning and behaviour of a system that
    doesn't include *how* it works internally. For example, how the API part of
    Seedcase connects and communicates with the other parts within Seedcase,
    but not how the API internally makes these connections and communications.
    "Black" implying unseen or not visible (e.g., night time).
  crud: |
    An acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These four actions are the
    core operations for data storage on computers.
  instance: |
    An Instance of Seedcase is .. <!--TODO Finish text here. -->
