In many fields of science, managing and structuring data in FAIR,
transparent, and discoverable ways can be a major barrier to fully using
data collected from a study. This is especially true of larger studies,
as experienced in many human health fields. This is largely a software
and training issue, complicated by the fact that funding is often
restricted for this type of work as it is often undervalued. For this
project, we aim to build software tools and training documentation that
make it easier to manage and work with data. More details are found on
the [landing page](https://seedcase-project.org) of the website.
