{{< include /includes/_wip.qmd >}}

Because Seedcase will be built with modularity in mind, each component
could be used (relatively) alone or together, nearly all the components
could be deliverables (each User by each layer). Each deliverable would
be to prototype a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to begin testing it,
identifying bugs, getting feedback, and establishing maintenance
procedures. In addition to each component being a deliverable, each
documentation or training section listed in @fig-roadmap-gantt could
also be a deliverable.

Acronyms used in the Gantt chart are: API for Application Programming
Interface; CRUD for Create, Read, Update, Delete; UI for User Interface;
and, MVP for Minimum Viable Product. Milestones are shown as diamonds.
