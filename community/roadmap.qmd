While the core deliverable of Seedcase is the software product described in the [design](/design/software-architecture/index.qmd) documentation, there are several deliverables that form this core Product.

Because of the evolving nature of developing software, the software product is never "completed" as it continues to be improved on and updated. So here we define deliverable for software as the first Minimally Viable Product (or prototype). After the first release of a Minimally Viable Product, the software product will continue to be tested and refined based on user feedback, identifying bugs, and adding features.

Likewise, our non-software projects will also continue to be refined and updated. So we define deliverable as the first time they are uploaded to an archive (like a software release) to create a DOI (digital object identifier).

## Primary deliverables
