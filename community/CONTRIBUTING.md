## Individual guide entries

These entries are small pages about a specific topic for contributing
and anyone can submit an entry to be added (or modify an existing one).

For team-specific contributing guidelines, check out our
[team.seedcase-project.org](https://team.seedcase-project.org/) website.

## Decisions on choices

For transparency and recordkeeping, we try to document and explain why
we make the decisions we make when it comes to building and organizing
the community.
