This document lists technical, political/organizational, and
convention-based constraints that we must consider when developing
Seedcase.

The main "philosophical" and value-based constraints are described in
the [Guiding
Principles](/design/software-architecture/introduction.qmd#guiding-principles)
section. These form the basis for all other decisions and designs. Some
of those constraints are summarized below.

## Technical constraints

| Constraints                                        | Background/Motivation                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux                   | Our potential users work on any of these systems, so need to design for that     |
| Use open source software dependencies              | We will use an open license, so need to use components that are open as well     |
| Use software that's (relatively) familiar to many  | We want others to contribute, so need to use tools others (likely) know          |
| Integrate GDPR, privacy, and security compliance   | Our target users work with health data, so this is vital to consider             |
| Deployable to servers and locally                  | Could be used locally but mainly used on a server environment                    |
| Storage and computing maybe be different locations | Where data are stored vs analyzed will likely be different, see subsection below |

## Organizational constraints

| Constraints                     | Background/Motivation                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Time schedule                   | Funding is until end of \~2027                                                                          |
| Resources                       | Currently only have a fixed set of funds                                                                |
| Small team                      | Only have 4-5 people on team, \~3 who are full-time                                                     |
| Limited knowledge/skill support | Data/software engineering is not common in research environments, so local knowledge/skills are limited |

## Political/legal constraints

| Constraints                        | Background/Motivation                                                                       |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use open source license            | For both practical and philosophical reasons, we will license Seedcase with an open license |
| Need endorsement from legal and IT | They have broad institutional influence, so at least having some support is vital           |

## Conventions

| Conventions                                      | Background/Motivation                                            |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Follow standard styling (e.g. PIP3)              | Coding style is vital to readability, so we follow best practice |
| Use [CalVer](https://calver.org/) versioning     | This style is simple and easily shows the age of the software    |
| Incorporate "Test/Doc-Driven Development" styles | Each has pros and cons, we use what works best                   |
