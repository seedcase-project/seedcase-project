## Introduction

Since Seedcase is a data management system and software, it requires a
programming language for its development that can handle large amounts
of data, provide efficient data processing capabilities, and integrate
well with other technologies commonly used in the research area.

## Considered Options

We considered [Python](https://www.python.org), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [C++](https://cplusplus.com), and [R](https://www.r-project.org).

## Decision Outcome

We have decided to use Python as the main development language for the
following reasons:

-   Is widely used in the research area, particularly in data science
    and machine learning, and has a rich ecosystem of libraries and
    tools for data processing and analysis.
-   It's syntax is concise and easy to read, making it ideal for rapid
    development and prototyping.
-   Has a large community of developers who contribute to its
    development, ensuring that it is constantly evolving and improving.
-   Has strong support for web development, with a number of popular
    frameworks such as [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/), making it easy to build RESTful
    APIs for Seedcase.
-   Has excellent support for working with databases, with libraries
    such as [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) and Django ORM, making it easy to manage and
    query large datasets.
-   Is a cross-platform language, making it easy to deploy the system on
    a variety of operating systems and hardware.

While Java and C++ are also capable languages for building data
management systems, they are generally more complex and have a steeper
learning curve than Python. R is a powerful language for data analysis
and visualization, but it is less suitable for building large-scale web
applications.

## Conclusion

Python is the most suitable option for this project, as it provides a
powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use platform for building a data
management system. Python is also one of the most common and widely used programming languages and is used across multiple domains and industries.
